🔥 Excellent — you’re absolutely right to focus on this nuance.
Let’s analyze this *specifically* in the context of **progressive resizing training** (starting small images → ending with large ones) and compare the three LR scheduling strategies:

---

## ⚙️ SCENARIO

You’re training with stages like:

```python
128px → 160px → 224px
```

with progressively larger data fractions and smaller batch sizes.

You want **maximum speed and stability** without hurting convergence.

---

## 🧠 STRATEGY 1 — **Global OneCycleLR (Single Continuous Schedule)** ✅ *(Recommended for your case)*

You define **one single OneCycleLR** for the *entire training* (e.g., 50 epochs total), and keep stepping it continuously — even as image size and dataset fraction change.

### ✅ Pros

| Benefit                            | Explanation                                                                                                                                               |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Smooth LR curve**                | LR decays only once, avoiding “re-heating” between stages — leads to stable convergence.                                                                  |
| **Momentum coupling preserved**    | OneCycleLR also manages momentum scheduling — keeping this continuous improves optimization dynamics.                                                     |
| **Ideal for progressive resizing** | You start with large LR for small images (fast exploration) and end with small LR for big images (fine-tuning). This matches OneCycle’s intent perfectly. |
| **Less hyperparameter tuning**     | No need to re-tune LR per stage — OneCycle automatically decays as total steps progress.                                                                  |
| **Faster overall convergence**     | Early small-image training acts as a warmup. By the time you reach high-res, model weights are well-initialized and LR is low.                            |

### ⚠️ Cons

| Limitation                                    | Impact                                                                                                                                           |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Different data size per stage**             | LR steps per epoch vary slightly if dataloader length changes. Must use `scheduler.step()` every batch — not per epoch — to keep it consistent.  |
| **No LR re-scaling for batch size**           | When batch size changes drastically (e.g., 1024 → 512), the “effective” LR per sample changes. You may slightly over/under step if not adjusted. |
| **Harder to checkpoint/resume across stages** | You can’t easily “recreate” the scheduler mid-training — must save `scheduler.state_dict()` properly.                                            |

---

## ⚙️ STRATEGY 2 — **Separate OneCycleLR per stage**

Each stage (e.g., 128px → 160px → 224px) gets its own OneCycleLR schedule.

### ✅ Pros

| Benefit                              | Explanation                                                 |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Independent control per stage**    | You can retune max_lr, pct_start, etc. for each image size. |
| **Adapts to changing dataset sizes** | Scheduler automatically fits per-stage steps.               |
| **Easy restarts**                    | Each stage starts fresh — simpler checkpointing.            |

### ⚠️ Cons

| Limitation                         | Impact                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ❌ **LR spikes between stages**     | Restarting OneCycle “heats up” again, which disrupts smooth optimization — often causes instability after early convergence. |
| ❌ **Loses OneCycle continuity**    | You break the smooth LR–momentum coupling that’s core to OneCycle’s success.                                                 |
| ⚠️ **Slower convergence overall**  | Each stage must “re-warm” the optimizer — wasting steps that could refine instead.                                           |
| ⚠️ **Requires retuning per stage** | Different resolutions and batch sizes need recalibrated `max_lr`, or you risk exploding gradients.                           |

---

## ⚙️ STRATEGY 3 — **Cosine Annealing per stage**

Each stage uses a cosine schedule:

```python
CosineAnnealingLR(optimizer, T_max=stage_epochs)
```

### ✅ Pros

| Benefit                            | Explanation                                                          |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Simple and smooth decay**        | No LR spikes — cosine naturally decays per stage.                    |
| **Safe default**                   | Very stable, no big oscillations.                                    |
| **Can combine with warm restarts** | Optionally use `CosineAnnealingWarmRestarts` for multi-stage cycles. |

### ⚠️ Cons

| Limitation                                  | Impact                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ⚠️ **Not globally aware**                   | Each stage decays independently — no global coordination.                                     |
| ⚠️ **May undertrain early, overtrain late** | Doesn’t automatically scale LR relative to progress in total training.                        |
| ⚠️ **Slightly slower convergence**          | Without OneCycle’s initial warmup spike, exploration is gentler — slower to find good minima. |

## 🚀 **Verdict (for Progressive Resizing)**

| Criterion                      | Global OneCycleLR | Per-Stage OneCycleLR | Cosine per Stage |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------- | -------------------- | ---------------- |
| Convergence Smoothness         | ✅✅✅               | ❌                    | ✅                |
| Training Speed                 | ✅✅✅               | ⚠️                   | ✅                |

| Tuning Effort                  | ✅                 | ⚠️                   | ✅                |
| Best for Progressive Resizing  | ✅✅✅ **(Winner)**  | ❌                    | ⚠️ (second-best) |

---

### ✅ TL;DR

For **progressive resizing**, the **global OneCycleLR** is the best strategy because:

* Early small images align with OneCycle’s high-LR exploration phase.
* Later large images align with its low-LR fine-tuning phase.
* Momentum coupling stays intact and convergence is faster.

> ⚡ In short: *Progressive resizing + global OneCycleLR = fast, stable, efficient training.*
