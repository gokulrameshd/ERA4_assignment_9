Ah! You’re asking about **`autocast` vs AMP**. Let’s clarify the difference carefully and practically.

### 1️⃣ What is AMP?

**AMP (Automatic Mixed Precision)** is **a PyTorch feature** that allows your model to use **mixed precision**:

* Some layers/operations in **float16 (FP16)** → faster, uses less GPU memory
* Other layers in **float32 (FP32)** → maintain numerical stability

AMP usually has two components:

1. `torch.cuda.amp.autocast` → automatically chooses FP16/FP32 for operations.
2. `torch.cuda.amp.GradScaler` → scales the loss to avoid FP16 underflow during backprop.

So when we say **AMP**, we usually mean **both `autocast` + `GradScaler`** together.

### 2️⃣ `autocast` alone

```python
with torch.cuda.amp.autocast():
    outputs = model(inputs)
    loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
```

* This **only handles the forward pass** in mixed precision.
* Backward pass is **still FP32 unless you scale manually**.
* If you just use `autocast` without `GradScaler`, FP16 gradients can underflow → unstable training.

✅ Good for inference / evaluation because no need for backward scaling.

### 3️⃣ Full AMP (recommended for training)

```python
scaler = torch.cuda.amp.GradScaler()

with torch.cuda.amp.autocast():
    outputs = model(inputs)
    loss = criterion(outputs, labels)

scaler.scale(loss).backward()
scaler.step(optimizer)
scaler.update()
```

* Forward pass → mixed precision (FP16/FP32 automatically)
* Backward pass → `GradScaler` ensures gradients don’t underflow
* Optimizer step → scaled gradients
* **Result:** stable, fast training, less GPU memory

### 4️⃣ Key points / comparison

| Feature            | `autocast` only       | Full AMP (autocast + GradScaler) |
| ------------------ | --------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Forward precision  | FP16/FP32             | FP16/FP32                        |
| Backward precision | FP32 (by default)     | Scaled FP16 → prevents underflow |
| Memory usage       | Reduced               | Reduced + safe gradients         |
| Stability          | Can underflow in FP16 | Safe (scaler prevents underflow) |
| Best for           | Inference             | Training                         |

### ✅ Recommendation:

* **Inference / validation** → `autocast` alone is fine
* **Training on GPU** → always use `autocast + GradScaler` (full AMP)

If you want, I can rewrite your **train_one_epoch** loop **with full AMP, OneCycleLR, Mixup, and scheduler in the correct order**, optimized for GPU and mixed precision.

Do you want me to do that?
