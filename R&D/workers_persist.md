Excellent question 👏 — and yes, **making DataLoader workers persistent (`persistent_workers=True`) can help** in *progressive resizing* setups like yours. But let’s go a bit deeper so you understand **why and when** it helps.

---

### 🧠 Background

When you train normally:

```python
DataLoader(..., num_workers=4, persistent_workers=False)
```

PyTorch creates new worker processes **every epoch**, then destroys them when the epoch ends.
That creation/destruction has a **noticeable CPU + I/O overhead** — especially when:

* Your dataset is large,
* Transformations (like resizing or augmentation) are expensive,
* You use progressive resizing (image size changes during training).

---

### ⚙️ What happens in progressive resizing

In progressive resizing, every few epochs your `Resize()` transform or your dataset logic changes image dimensions (say 64 → 128 → 224).
That means:

* PyTorch needs to reinitialize or reapply transforms.
* When workers restart at each epoch, they reload/reshuffle everything.
* Transform computation + worker creation = delay → longer per-epoch time.

---

### ✅ Solution

Use:

```python
train_loader = DataLoader(
    train_dataset,
    batch_size=256,
    shuffle=True,
    num_workers=8,
    pin_memory=True,
    persistent_workers=True,  # ✅ keeps workers alive between epochs
)
```

This way:

* The workers stay alive after the first epoch.
* No fork/spawn overhead at the start of each epoch.
* Subsequent epochs start faster.
* You often see **~5–15% speed improvement per epoch**, especially when using CPU-heavy augmentations or progressive resizing.

---

### ⚠️ When it *won’t* help

* If you constantly **recreate your DataLoader** when resizing (e.g., new dataset instance each time), then the workers will still restart.
  ✅ Instead, modify only the **transform pipeline** dynamically, not the loader itself.

* If your data pipeline is I/O bound (slow disk), persistent workers help less.

---

### 🧩 Ideal combo

```python
DataLoader(
    dataset,
    batch_size=256,
    num_workers=8,
    pin_memory=True,
    persistent_workers=True,
    prefetch_factor=2,     # optional, good with fast GPUs
)
torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark = True  # for varying image sizes
```

Would you like me to show you a **pattern for progressive resizing** that *keeps the same DataLoader and workers alive* (so you actually benefit from persistence)? It’s a small but important structural trick.
