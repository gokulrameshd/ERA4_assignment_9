Excellent question — and it’s a **very important design choice** for ImageNet validation. Let’s break it down clearly 👇

---

## ✅ **Short Answer**

> For ImageNet-1K validation, **use `Resize(256)` followed by `CenterCrop(224)`** (for 224×224 training resolution).
> This is the **standard and recommended setup**.

## 🧠 **Why CenterCrop (and not just Resize)?**

Let’s analyze the reasoning:

| Transform                         | What It Does                                          | Pros                                                   | Cons                                                               |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Resize(224)**                   | Warps the entire image to 224×224                     | Fast, simple                                           | **Distorts aspect ratio**, hurting validation accuracy consistency |
| **Resize(256) → CenterCrop(224)** | Scales shortest side to 256 px, then crops the center | Keeps **aspect ratio** intact, matches training FOV    | Slightly more compute (negligible)                                 |
| **No Crop (just Resize bigger)**  | Keeps full image content                              | Field of view mismatch (model expects cropped framing) | Causes accuracy drop                                               |

## 🧩 **Why “Resize to 1.14 × train_size”?**

* The **256/224 = 1.14 ratio** comes from the original **ResNet paper (He et al., 2015)**.
* During training, random crops cover ~87.5% of the original area.
* At validation, resizing by 1.14 and taking a center crop **mimics the average field of view** seen during training.

Hence:

```python
v2.Resize(int(img_size * 1.14)),  # typically 256
v2.CenterCrop(img_size),          # typically 224
```

This ensures **fair and consistent validation metrics** across all ImageNet models (ResNet, ViT, ConvNeXt, etc.).

---

## 🧪 **Quick Example (Validation Transform)**

```python
val_transforms = v2.Compose([
    v2.Resize(int(img_size * 1.14)),  # = 256 for 224 training
    v2.CenterCrop(img_size),          # = 224
    v2.ToDtype(torch.float32, scale=True),
    v2.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406],
                 std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]),
    v2.ToDevice(device="cuda"),
])
```

✅ Matches torchvision + timm + OpenAI CLIP default evaluation pipeline.

## ⚡ **When to Use Resize (No Crop)**

You’d only do this in:

* **Speed-sensitive testing** (e.g., low-end hardware).
* **Non-square datasets** (e.g., medical images, detection crops).
* Or if you’ve trained your model *without* random cropping (rare for ImageNet).

### **Summary**

| Task       | Recommended Transform           | Reason                                                      |
| ---------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Training   | `RandomResizedCrop(224)`        | Provides variation, robust to scale/aspect ratio            |
| Validation | `Resize(256) → CenterCrop(224)` | Matches expected FOV, keeps aspect ratio, standard protocol |

---

Ah! I see the confusion — let’s clarify carefully.

---

## 1️⃣ What is **val**?

In standard ML pipelines:

* `train` dataset: used to **train** the model. We apply **random augmentations** (RandomResizedCrop, flips, color jitter, etc.) to improve generalization.
* `val` dataset (validation): used to **evaluate** model performance **during or after training**.

  * No random augmentation is applied.
  * Goal: measure **true accuracy** on unseen data.

So **`val` is for consistent evaluation**, not for training or regularization.

---

## 2️⃣ Why we usually **Resize + CenterCrop** instead of only Resize

For ImageNet, training uses **RandomResizedCrop(224)**. That means each training crop is **random in position and scale**:

* Covers roughly 87–100% of the image area
* Random aspect ratio (within limits)

To fairly evaluate, we want the **center of the image** and similar scale. That’s why the standard is:

```python
Resize(256) -> CenterCrop(224)
```

* Resize shortest side to 256 (keeps aspect ratio)
* CenterCrop to 224 (matches training input size)

This ensures the evaluation is **comparable across models**, even if they trained with random crops.

---

## 3️⃣ What happens if you **Resize to 224 and do not crop**?

```python
val_transforms = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.Resize(224),
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize(mean, std)
])
```

* Pros:

  * Simpler, fewer operations
  * Works fine for small-scale experiments
* Cons:

  * Changes aspect ratio → image can be **squished or stretched**
  * Field-of-view is slightly different from training crops → small drop in validation accuracy
  * Not standard in ImageNet benchmarks (makes your results **non-comparable**)

💡 For ImageNet-1K models, **most papers/reporting use Resize+CenterCrop**.

| `Resize(224)` only               | Quick experiments / small datasets | Distorts images, may slightly hurt accuracy       |
