Excellent question — and this shows you’re thinking about the **training dynamics**, not just running code.
Let’s go deep into this 👇 — because the choice of **optimizer for ResNet-50 (which ends with a fully connected classifier)** is one of the biggest factors affecting convergence speed and final accuracy.

---

## ⚙️ First, a quick recap of ResNet-50 structure

ResNet-50 has:

* Convolutional backbone (Conv + BN + ReLU blocks)
* Global average pooling
* **1 fully connected (FC) layer** (2048 → 1000 for ImageNet-1K)

That FC layer is **tiny** compared to the conv backbone (<2% of parameters).
So your optimizer choice should mainly suit **deep convolutional layers**, not the FC head.

## 🧠 Key optimizers considered

| Optimizer                | Pros                                                  | Cons                                              | Typical use                             |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **SGD + Momentum (0.9)** | Stable, generalizes best, scales well with large data | Needs LR tuning, slower early convergence         | Gold-standard for ImageNet CNNs         |
| **Adam / AdamW**         | Fast convergence, easier to tune                      | Slightly worse generalization, heavier memory use | Great for fine-tuning or small datasets |
| **LARS / LAMB**          | Stable for huge batches (≥8k)                         | Overkill for small GPU setups                     | Large distributed training              |
| **Lion (Google, 2023)**  | Fast & memory-efficient                               | Still experimental                                | Mixed results for CNNs                  |

## ✅ **Recommended for ResNet-50 from scratch on ImageNet-1K**

### 🔹 **1. SGD + Momentum (classical but still best)**

This is **still the optimizer used in nearly all high-accuracy ImageNet baselines**, including:

* ResNet, RegNet, ConvNeXt, EfficientNet (original), and many timm recipes.

**Config:**

```python
optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(
    model.parameters(),
    lr=0.1,               # for batch_size=256
    momentum=0.9,
    weight_decay=1e-4,
    nesterov=True
)
```

**Why it’s ideal:**

* Works extremely well with BatchNorm (BN assumes consistent gradient statistics).
* Produces smoother, flatter minima → better generalization.
* Very memory efficient → fits large batch sizes on GPUs.
* Fully connected head trains perfectly fine with it — you don’t need Adam just because of the FC layer.

**Scaling rule (linear LR scaling):**
[
\text{lr} = 0.1 \times \frac{\text{batch_size}}{256}
]
So if your global batch = 64 → `lr = 0.025`.

---

### 🔹 **2. AdamW (modern adaptive option)**

If you use lots of augmentations (Mixup, CutMix, RandAugment) or lower batch sizes (≤64), **AdamW** can make convergence easier.

**Config:**

```python
optimizer = torch.optim.AdamW(
    model.parameters(),
    lr=1e-3,              # start smaller for OneCycleLR
    betas=(0.9, 0.999),
    weight_decay=0.05
)
```

**Why it’s good:**

* Handles noisy gradients better at small batch sizes.
* Works great with OneCycleLR (you can use higher max_lr safely).
* Faster initial convergence.

**Downsides:**

* May end up 0.2–0.4% lower in Top-1 accuracy on full ImageNet after long runs.
* Slightly worse generalization (less flat minima).

---

### 🔹 **3. Hybrid strategy (optional)**

Some people:

* Train 90% epochs with **SGD**, then
* Switch to **AdamW** or **Adam** for last few epochs for rapid fine-tuning.

But usually not needed unless you’re experimenting.

## ⚔️ **SGD vs AdamW Summary for ResNet-50**

| Criterion                 | **SGD + Momentum**                                    | **AdamW**                            |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Convergence speed         | Slower initially                                      | Faster early                         |
| Final accuracy (Top-1)    | ✅ Higher (~+0.3–0.5%)                                 | Slightly lower                       |
| Generalization            | ✅ Better                                              | Slightly worse                       |
| Learning rate sensitivity | Needs careful LR tuning                               | More forgiving                       |
| Best with                 | Large dataset, BatchNorm, long training (≥100 epochs) | Small batches, heavy aug, short runs |
| Memory usage              | Low                                                   | Higher (~1.5×)                       |

## 💡 **My recommendation for your setup**

Since you said:

> “I’m training ResNet-50 from scratch on ImageNet-1K”

…and assuming your GPU is **RTX 5060 Ti (16 GB)** — i.e. moderate compute, likely **batch size ≤ 128** —

👉 **Use SGD + Momentum** with OneCycleLR:

```python
optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(
    model.parameters(),
    lr=0.1 * (batch_size / 256),
    momentum=0.9,
    weight_decay=1e-4,
    nesterov=True
)
```

Then set your **OneCycleLR**:

```python
scheduler = torch.optim.lr_scheduler.OneCycleLR(
    optimizer,
    max_lr=0.1 * (batch_size / 256),
    total_steps=epochs * len(train_loader),
    pct_start=0.3,
    div_factor=25,
    final_div_factor=1e4,
    anneal_strategy='cos',
)
```

This pair (SGD + OneCycleLR) is proven and used in fast ImageNet training recipes (e.g., FastAI, timm, PyTorch examples).

---

✅ **Final answer:**

> Use **SGD + momentum (0.9)** with **weight decay 1e-4** — it’s optimal for ResNet-50 (even though it has FC layers).
> Pair it with **OneCycleLR** for fast convergence.
> Use **AdamW** only if your batch size is small or you’re experimenting with heavy augmentations.

Would you like me to show you the **exact PyTorch training loop (optimizer + OneCycle + EMA)** that’s tuned for an RTX 5060 Ti (batch 64–128) setup?
It would be a drop-in, production-ready template for your ImageNet run.
