Excellent ‚Äî this is an important question üëè

When training **ResNet-50 on ImageNet-1K**, deciding **how many layers to freeze** depends on your **training goal** ‚Äî from **fine-tuning** (fast adaptation) to **full training** (from scratch). Let‚Äôs break it down carefully.

---

## üß† 1. How to freeze layers

In PyTorch:

```python
for param in model.layer1.parameters():
    param.requires_grad = False
```

You can freeze multiple stages:

```python
for name, child in model.named_children():
    if name in ["conv1", "bn1", "layer1", "layer2"]:
        for param in child.parameters():
            param.requires_grad = False
```

Then, only unfreeze the deeper layers (`layer3`, `layer4`, `fc`).

---

## üß© 2. Layer structure in ResNet-50

ResNet-50 has 5 main stages:

| Stage | Module name                    | Output size      | Typical Role                 |
| ----- | ------------------------------ | ---------------- | ---------------------------- |
| 1     | `conv1 + bn1 + relu + maxpool` | 112√ó112          | Low-level edges, color blobs |
| 2     | `layer1`                       | 56√ó56            | Simple textures              |
| 3     | `layer2`                       | 28√ó28            | Mid-level patterns           |
| 4     | `layer3`                       | 14√ó14            | Object parts                 |
| 5     | `layer4`                       | 7√ó7              | High-level semantics         |
| 6     | `fc`                           | 1000‚Üínum_classes | Classification               |

---

## üß≠ 3. Recommended strategy by scenario

### üß© **A. Training from scratch (your case)**

* **Freeze: None**
* **Why:**
  You‚Äôre starting from random weights (or custom pretrain), so every layer must learn features from ImageNet itself.
  Freezing would block gradient flow and limit accuracy severely.
* ‚úÖ **Recommendation:** train all layers.

---

### üß© **B. Fine-tuning from pretrained weights (e.g., ImageNet‚Üínew dataset)**

If your weights are pretrained on ImageNet and your dataset is smaller:

| Dataset size        | Recommended freeze                       | Reason                                            |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Small (<10k images) | Freeze up to `layer3`                    | Prevent overfitting; keep general visual features |
| Medium (10k‚Äì100k)   | Freeze `conv1`, `layer1`, maybe `layer2` | Fine-tune higher layers for adaptation            |
| Large (>100k)       | Unfreeze all                             | Enough data to learn effectively                  |

You can also **progressively unfreeze** (common in transfer learning):

```python
# Initially freeze everything
for param in model.parameters():
    param.requires_grad = False

# Then unfreeze deeper layers
for param in model.layer3.parameters():
    param.requires_grad = True
for param in model.layer4.parameters():
    param.requires_grad = True
for param in model.fc.parameters():
    param.requires_grad = True
```

---

## üîç 4. Practical tip

You can verify which parameters are frozen:

```python
for name, param in model.named_parameters():
    print(name, param.requires_grad)
```

---

## üèÅ 5. TL;DR Recommendation (for your setup)

| Case                                                         | Freeze layers                       | Why                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Training from scratch on ImageNet-1K**                     | ‚ùå Freeze none                       | All layers need to learn features            |
| **Fine-tuning from pretrained on ImageNet to a new dataset** | ‚úÖ Freeze up to `layer2` or `layer3` | Prevent overfitting and speed up             |
| **Limited GPU / memory**                                     | Freeze early layers                 | Saves memory but slightly slower convergence |

If you tell me whether you‚Äôre using:

* **ImageNet-1K full dataset**, and
* whether your `weights="./best_weights.pth"` are **pretrained or random**,

I can show you the **exact `create_model()` implementation** ‚Äî including **progressive unfreezing + optimizer param groups** (different LR for frozen/unfrozen parts).

Excellent ‚Äî this is a **very common gotcha** when mixing `torchvision`‚Äôs new `weights` API with custom `.pth` checkpoints.
Let‚Äôs break it down clearly üëá

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Why you got the error

```python
model = models.resnet50(weights=weights)
```

The argument `weights` here is **not** a path to your `.pth` file.
It expects a **`torchvision.models.ResNet50_Weights` enum**, e.g.:

```python
weights = models.ResNet50_Weights.IMAGENET1K_V1
```

When you pass `"./best_weights.pth"`, it tries to find a pretrained enum named `"./best_weights.pth"`, fails, and raises:

```
KeyError: './best_weights.pth'
```

---

## ‚úÖ The Correct Approach

You need to:

1. **Load the model architecture** using `weights=None` or pretrained enum.
2. **Manually load your `.pth` weights** with `model.load_state_dict()`.

Here‚Äôs your fixed version üëá

---

### ‚úÖ Fixed `create_finetuned_model` (fully working)

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from torchvision import models

def create_finetuned_model(num_classes, weights_path="./best_weights.pth"):
    """
    Create a ResNet-50 for fine-tuning with selective layer freezing.
    """
    # 1Ô∏è‚É£ Initialize model (you can also use pretrained=IMAGENET1K_V1)
    model = models.resnet50(weights=None)  # don't pass custom path here

    # 2Ô∏è‚É£ Replace classifier for your dataset
    model.fc = nn.Linear(model.fc.in_features, num_classes)

    # 3Ô∏è‚É£ Load your custom weights if available
    if weights_path and os.path.exists(weights_path):
        print(f"‚úÖ Loading custom weights from {weights_path}")
        state_dict = torch.load(weights_path, map_location="cpu")
        # if saved with model.state_dict() only
        if "state_dict" in state_dict:  # handle checkpoints with wrapped dicts
            state_dict = state_dict["state_dict"]
        missing, unexpected = model.load_state_dict(state_dict, strict=False)
        print(f"‚ÑπÔ∏è Missing keys: {missing}")
        print(f"‚ÑπÔ∏è Unexpected keys: {unexpected}")
    else:
        print("‚ö†Ô∏è No pretrained weights found ‚Äî training from scratch")

    # 4Ô∏è‚É£ Freeze lower layers (conv1 through layer2)
    for name, child in model.named_children():
        if name in ["conv1", "bn1", "layer1", "layer2"]:
            for param in child.parameters():
                param.requires_grad = False

    # 5Ô∏è‚É£ Unfreeze deeper layers
    for name, child in model.named_children():
        if name in ["layer3", "layer4", "fc"]:
            for param in child.parameters():
                param.requires_grad = True

    return model
```

## üß† Why this structure

| Layer                              | Trainable?  | Why                                                                                    |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `conv1`, `bn1`, `layer1`, `layer2` | ‚ùå Frozen    | Contain low-level features (edges, color gradients) that transfer well across datasets |
| `layer3`, `layer4`, `fc`           | ‚úÖ Trainable | Contain high-level object features that must adapt to your new dataset (50 classes)    |

This setup:

* Speeds up training ‚úÖ
* Prevents overfitting ‚úÖ
* Keeps gradient computation focused where it matters ‚úÖ

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Optional ‚Äî Fine-tuning Optimizer Setup

When you freeze lower layers, you can assign **different learning rates**:

```python
trainable_params = [
    {"params": model.layer3.parameters(), "lr": 1e-4},
    {"params": model.layer4.parameters(), "lr": 1e-4},
    {"params": model.fc.parameters(), "lr": 5e-4},
]

optimizer = torch.optim.AdamW(trainable_params, weight_decay=1e-4)
```

Would you like me to include **progressive unfreezing** support too?
(i.e., automatically unfreeze `layer2` after a few epochs for smoother fine-tuning)
