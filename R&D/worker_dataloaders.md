Ah, yes — this is a **classic PyTorch DataLoader multiprocessing issue** that often shows up when using `spawn` or large batch sizes / multiple workers, especially with **progressive resizing**. Let me break it down and give solutions:

---

### **Why it happens**

1. **Worker crash**:

   * Your DataLoader workers are dying unexpectedly.
   * Could be due to **OOM**, invalid memory access, or multiprocessing bugs.
2. **`spawn` + DataLoader**:

   * On Linux, you are using `mp.set_start_method("spawn")`.
   * `spawn` is safer but more memory-hungry.
3. **Large batch sizes**:

   * With `BATCH_SIZE=256` or higher and high-resolution images, GPU/CPU memory might blow up.
4. **Autocast / AMP + multiple workers**:

   * Sometimes combined with progressive resizing, workers might not release memory correctly.
5. **Python 3.12 + PyTorch**:

   * Some multiprocessing APIs behave slightly differently; `_MultiProcessingDataLoaderIter` warnings are common.

---

### **Practical Fixes**

#### 1️⃣ Reduce `num_workers`

```python
train_loader, val_loader, num_classes = get_dataloaders(DATA_DIR, BATCH_SIZE, IMG_SIZE, num_workers=4)
```

* Start small (`num_workers=2-4`) to see if workers still die.
* Increase later if memory is sufficient.

#### 2️⃣ Pin memory for faster CPU → GPU transfer

```python
train_loader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=BATCH_SIZE, shuffle=True, num_workers=4, pin_memory=True)
```

#### 3️⃣ Use `persistent_workers=False` (default)

```python
train_loader = DataLoader(..., persistent_workers=False)
```

* When using progressive resizing, worker re-initialization on each stage can conflict if `persistent_workers=True`.

#### 4️⃣ Lower batch size for high-resolution stages

* 224 or higher resolution with `BATCH_SIZE=256` + `num_workers>4` can exceed memory.
* Try `BATCH_SIZE=128` for 224×224 and higher stages.

#### 5️⃣ Avoid `mp.set_start_method("spawn")` unless necessary

* Default on Linux is `fork`, which is lighter.
* Only use `spawn` if you get fork-related errors.

```python
# try removing:
# mp.set_start_method("spawn", force=True)
```

#### 6️⃣ Wrap main in `if __name__ == "__main__":`

You already do this, which is correct. Essential for `spawn`.

#### 7️⃣ Debug worker errors

* Use a try-except inside `__getitem__` of your Dataset.

```python
def __getitem__(self, idx):
    try:
        # load and transform
        ...
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Dataset error at idx {idx}: {e}")
        raise e
```

#### 8️⃣ Mixed precision caution

* Sometimes `autocast` + progressive resizing causes unexpected GPU memory issues.
* Try disabling AMP temporarily for debugging:

```python
# scaler = GradScaler(enabled=False)
```

### **Summary of Recommended Changes for Your Pipeline**

```python
# get_dataloaders signature change
train_loader, val_loader, num_classes = get_dataloaders(
    DATA_DIR, BATCH_SIZE, IMG_SIZE, num_workers=4, pin_memory=True
)

# optionally lower batch_size for large IMG_SIZE stages
if IMG_SIZE >= 224:
    BATCH_SIZE = 128
```

---

✅ **Next Steps**:

1. Reduce `num_workers` and/or `BATCH_SIZE`.
2. Keep `pin_memory=True`.
3. Check Dataset `__getitem__` for errors.
4. Avoid `spawn` unless necessary.

---

If you want, I can **rewrite your progressive resizing main loop** to automatically **adjust batch size per stage and handle DataLoader safely** to prevent these crashes.

Do you want me to do that?
